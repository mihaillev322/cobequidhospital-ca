<h1>About this Cobequid Hospital information site for Canada</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Our purpose and what we cover</h2>
<p>This website is an independent informational resource designed to help residents and visitors in Canada—particularly those in the Halifax and Nova Scotia region—understand their options for emergency care, urgent care, and community health centre services. We provide context on Cobequid Hospital, the emergency department, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, and outpatient diagnostics, with a focus on plain-language explanations and practical guidance.</p>
<p><strong>This site is not affiliated with any official hospital, health authority, or government agency.</strong> We are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Our goal is to offer clear, expert authoritative information that empowers you to make informed decisions about where to seek care, what to expect, and how to prepare. We cover topics such as how to interpret emergency wait times, the differences between care settings, when to call 911, and what to bring to a healthcare facility.</p>
<p>All content is written with a focus on accuracy, accessibility, and transparency. We recognize that navigating the healthcare system can be confusing, especially during a medical crisis, and we aim to reduce that confusion by presenting information in a straightforward, organized manner. Whether you are looking for details on cobequid hospital services, community health centre programs, or emergency department protocols, this site is designed to be a trusted starting point for your research. For authoritative health information, we encourage you to consult <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html" rel="external">Health Canada</a> and other official sources.</p>
</section>

<section id="editorial-standards">
<h2>Editorial standards and how we use sources</h2>
<p>We are committed to providing information that is accurate, up-to-date, and grounded in reputable sources. Our editorial approach prioritizes content from provincial and federal health authorities, academic institutions, peer-reviewed research, and established healthcare organizations. We regularly review and update our content to reflect changes in healthcare policy, facility services, and best practices in emergency and urgent care.</p>
<p>When we reference external sources, we link to authoritative websites such as government health departments, universities, and recognized public health organizations. For example, we draw on resources from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html" rel="external">Health Canada</a>, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" rel="external">National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a>, and other trusted institutions. We also use general reference sources like Wikipedia for background context on medical terms and healthcare systems, always cross-referencing with primary sources where possible.</p>
<p>Our writing tone is expert authoritative, meaning we present information with confidence and clarity while acknowledging the limits of what an informational website can provide. We do not offer medical advice, and we always encourage readers to confirm details—such as hours, services, and wait times—directly with healthcare facilities or provincial health authorities. Transparency is central to our mission: we want you to understand not only what we cover, but also how and why we cover it.</p>

<section id="accessibility">
<h2>Accessibility and plain-language approach</h2>
<p>Accessibility is a core value of this site. We use Swiss typography principles to create a clean, highly readable layout with strong grid rhythm, generous whitespace, and a clear visual hierarchy. Our color palette is designed to meet WCAG contrast standards, ensuring that text is legible for users with low vision or color blindness. Interactive elements such as links, buttons, and accordion controls feature high-contrast focus-visible outlines, making keyboard navigation straightforward and intuitive.</p>
<p>We write in plain language, avoiding jargon wherever possible and defining technical terms when they are necessary. Our goal is to make healthcare information accessible to all readers, regardless of their familiarity with medical terminology. We also support users who prefer reduced motion: our CSS includes a prefers-reduced-motion media query that disables animations and transitions for those who have indicated this preference in their browser or operating system settings. For more on plain-language principles, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_language" rel="external">Plain Language article on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Semantic HTML5 markup ensures that our content is accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies. We use proper heading hierarchy, descriptive link text, and ARIA labels where appropriate. Tables include captions and headers to provide context, and accordion controls are implemented with native HTML details and summary elements for maximum compatibility and usability.</p>

<section id="closing">
<h2>Safety note and how to use this guide</h2>
<p>We cannot emphasize enough: <strong>if you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately.</strong> Do not rely on online information, wait-time estimates, or any other resource when you need urgent intervention. This site is designed to help you understand your options and prepare for non-emergency healthcare visits, but it is not a substitute for professional medical judgment or emergency services.</p>
<p>Before visiting any healthcare facility, confirm current hours, services, and any special instructions by calling ahead or checking the facility's official website. Healthcare systems are dynamic, and information can change due to staffing, patient volume, public health events, or other factors. We strive to keep our content accurate and current, but we encourage you to verify details with official sources.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting this site. We hope the information here helps you navigate the Canadian healthcare system with confidence and clarity. If you have feedback or suggestions for how we can improve, please consider reaching out through official channels or community forums. Our commitment is to transparency, accessibility, and providing the expert authoritative guidance you need to make informed healthcare decisions.</p>
