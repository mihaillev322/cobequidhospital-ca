<summary>What services does a community health centre provide?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p><strong>Community health centres offer emergency care, urgent care, walk-in clinic services, diagnostic imaging, laboratory services, and various outpatient medical treatments.</strong></p>
<p>The specific services available at a community health centre can vary significantly depending on the province, the size of the facility, and the needs of the local population. In Nova Scotia and other Canadian provinces, community health centres are designed to provide accessible, patient-centered care that goes beyond traditional hospital emergency departments. Many centres offer chronic disease management programs, mental health and addiction services, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, and health education.</p>
<p>To confirm which services are available at a specific community health centre, check the facility's official website or call their main line. Some centres operate 24/7 emergency departments, while others have limited hours for urgent care or walk-in services. Diagnostic imaging such as X-rays and ultrasounds, as well as laboratory services for bloodwork and other tests, are commonly available on-site or through referral. Understanding the full range of services can help you access the right care at the right time, whether you need immediate attention or ongoing support for a chronic condition.

<summary>How can I check hospital emergency wait times?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p><strong>Most hospitals display current emergency department wait times on their official websites or through provincial health authority online portals.</strong></p>
<p>Emergency wait times are typically updated in real time or at regular intervals throughout the day, giving patients and families a general sense of how long they might wait to be seen by a physician. However, it is crucial to understand that these estimates are based on current conditions and can change rapidly. Triage is the process used in emergency departments to prioritize patients based on the severity of their condition. If you arrive with a lower-priority issue, you may wait longer than the posted estimate if multiple high-priority cases come in after you.</p>
<p>Provincial health authorities in Canada, including those in Nova Scotia, often maintain centralized online portals where you can view emergency wait times for multiple facilities in your region. These tools are helpful for planning, but they should never be used to delay seeking care if your symptoms are serious or worsening. If you are unsure whether your condition requires emergency care, consider calling a provincial health information line or consulting with a healthcare provider. Triage protocols are designed to ensure that the most critical patients receive immediate attention, so even if wait times appear long, life-threatening cases are prioritized. For more information on triage and emergency care processes, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage" rel="external">Triage article on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<summary>What is the difference between urgent care and emergency room?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p><strong>Emergency rooms treat life-threatening conditions, while urgent care facilities handle non-life-threatening injuries and illnesses that require prompt attention.</strong></p>
<p>Understanding the distinction between an urgent care facility and an emergency room is essential for choosing the right care setting. Emergency rooms, also known as emergency departments, are equipped to handle severe, life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, major trauma, severe bleeding, and difficulty breathing. They operate 24/7 and have access to advanced diagnostic tools, surgical teams, and intensive care units. Urgent care facilities, on the other hand, are designed for conditions that need prompt attention but are not immediately life-threatening—such as sprains, minor fractures, cuts that may need stitches, infections, and moderate pain.</p>
<p>Urgent care centres often have shorter wait times than emergency departments because they see fewer critical cases, and they may offer extended hours, including evenings and weekends, when family doctors' offices are closed. Some urgent care facilities can perform X-rays and basic lab tests on-site, and they can provide referrals to specialists or emergency departments if your condition is more serious than initially assessed. After-hours considerations are also important: if you need care outside of regular clinic hours and your condition is not life-threatening, an urgent care facility may be the most efficient option. For more guidance on when to seek emergency care, visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/emergency/index.html" rel="external">CDC's emergency preparedness resources</a>.</p>

<summary>When should I visit an emergency department?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p><strong>Visit an emergency department for severe injuries, chest pain, difficulty breathing, major bleeding, or any life-threatening medical condition.</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing the warning signs of a medical emergency can save lives. You should go to an emergency department or call 911 immediately if you or someone else experiences chest pain or pressure, sudden severe headache, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, signs of stroke (such as facial drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulty), major bleeding that does not stop with pressure, severe abdominal pain, loss of consciousness, seizures, or any injury from a serious accident. Other urgent situations include suspected poisoning, severe allergic reactions, high fever with confusion or stiff neck, and sudden vision loss.</p>
<p>When you visit an emergency department, bring your health card, a list of current medications (including dosages), known allergies, and any relevant medical history. If possible, have a family member or friend accompany you to provide support and help communicate with healthcare providers. If you are unsure whether your symptoms warrant an emergency department visit, err on the side of caution and seek care—or call a provincial health information line for guidance. Emergency departments use triage to prioritize patients, so even if you arrive and wait, you can be reassured that those with the most critical needs are being seen first.

<summary>Where can I find walk in clinic services?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p><strong>Walk-in clinic services are available at community health centres, medical clinics, and some hospital facilities without requiring an appointment.</strong></p>
<p>Walk-in clinics provide convenient access to healthcare for routine and minor concerns that do not require the resources of an emergency department or the immediacy of urgent care. Common reasons to visit a walk-in clinic include rashes, mild respiratory symptoms, minor infections, prescription renewals (where offered), routine physical exams, and follow-up care for stable chronic conditions. Many walk-in clinics operate on a first-come, first-served basis, though some now offer online check-in or virtual queuing to reduce wait times.</p>
<p>To find walk-in clinic services in your area, consult provincial health directories, search online for local clinics, or call your provincial health information line. Some community health centres offer walk-in hours in addition to scheduled appointments, and certain hospital facilities have walk-in clinics for non-urgent care. It is always a good idea to call ahead to confirm hours, services offered, and whether the clinic is accepting new patients that day. Virtual care options are also increasingly available in Canada, allowing you to consult with a healthcare provider by phone or video for certain conditions. When visiting a walk-in clinic, bring your health card, a list of current medications, and any relevant medical records or test results.
